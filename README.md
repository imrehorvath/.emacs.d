# My Emacs settings

These are my Emacs settings to be used across the machines I use.

## Acknowledgements

These settings were created using the great starting point provided by Technomancy, the [better-defaults](https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults) and the superb collection of diverse settings customized by Magnar, the [.emacs.d](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d).

Thanks guys!

## About

These settings are subject to change over time as the different needs are coming and going.
Also I expect to refactor it and to break it up into smaller pieces as the complexity grows.
